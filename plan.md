# If profile photo:

Add the profile photo ProfilePic.png to the right side of the first intro section so that it doesnt offset the beautiful text that is left aligned (ie title and subtitle, and the view projects buttons)Note how there is plenty of space in the right side in the image that I attached.
Format it in a way that would match the current theme, i think that would mean rounding the corners a bit.
