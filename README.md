This is a react portfolio website for Greg Shklovski.

## Purpose:
To provide a clear, accessible showcase of my robotics and machine learning work—highlighting projects, publications, and technical skills—so that professors, industry leaders, and collaborators can quickly gauge my expertise, tools familiarity, and track record.
